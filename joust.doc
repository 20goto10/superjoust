SuperJoust! It's like Joust, only better, and quite different.
(If you want a true-to-arcade Joust simulator, check out Dave/Ron Sharpless'
Joust-VGA which is excellent.)
SuperJoust is Joust for those who want to play against other humans in
new and exotic ways.  SuperJoust is a cross between Joust, Star Control,
and Mail Order Monsters (a classic, try to find it if you have a C64.)

Chapter 1.........Command Line Options

  There is one command line option.  Type JOUST [insert anything here] and
you can skip the intro scene.

Chapter 2.........The Options Menu

Keys:
1,2,3,4  --  Change mount for players 1,2,3,4, respectively.
A,B,I,L  --  Change special ability for players 1,2,3,4, respectively.
             The abilities are:
             NONE - No special ability, obviously.
             STUNNING SQUAWK - Stuns the other players mounts, thus
              forcing them to lose control for a few moments.  When a
              player's mount is stunned, stars appear above it's head.
             DROPPING BELLOW - Makes all other players fall a few feet,
              without changing their velocities.
             UNHARMABILITY - The player cannot be harmed by anything.
              He will pass over mines, shots, and through other players.
              When a unharmability is active, a field appears around the
              player.  When two unharmable players collide, neither is
              hurt.  If they are at exactly the same level, they bounce
              off.
             INVISIBILITY - The player cannot be seen by anyone.  When
              a player is invisible, his icon disapears also.
             LIGHTNING ARMOR - Lightning armor kills other players,
              stops bullets, and clears away mines.  When this is
              active, an electric field appears around the player.
              When two lightning-active players collide, the event
              is resolved in the normal manner.
             SWITCH ANIMAL - Changes the type of mount a player is
              flying on.
             SHOOT BULLET - Fires a bullet from the player's lance.  The
              bullet travels faster than any of the mounts.  If it hits
              a player with lightning armor, the bullet dies.  If it
              hits a mine, the mine explodes without harming players.
              If it hits an unprotected player, the player dies.  The
              bullet stops when it gets to the edge of the screen.  It
              cannot harm it's shooter.
             DROP MINE - Leaves a mine wherever the player is.  The
              player cannot be hurt by his own mine.  Mines can be shot
              down by bullets, or cleared by players with lightning
              armor.  If a player hits a mine unprotected, the player is
              killed.
             [default:NONE]
V        --  Turns waiting for vertical retrace on/off.
             On certain monitors, the screen flickers if this is off.
             This will slow down the game a tiny bit. [default: OFF]
+/-      --  Increase game delay.  '+' slows the game down.  This puts
             a longer pause into the time between cycles of the game,
             which can help slow it down for playing on faster
             computers. '-' speeds up the game.  On a 386, 0 is a good
             delay, and can even be too fast for some levels.  On a 486
             a higher delay is necessary. [default: 0]
R        --  Reset the winner statistics to 0 for each player.
S        --  Special abilities on/off.  With this off, the game is
             much more like the classic version. [default: ON]
P        --  Turns on/off platforms.  Platforms off speeds up the
             game a lot, but it also ruins puzzle/goal-type levels.
             [default: ON]
N        --  Turns numbers above the players on/off.  This alleviates
             confusion over which player is which, the classic "Which
             guy am I?" problem. [default: OFF]
U        --  Unharmable opening on/off.  If this is on, all players
             spend the first 100 game cycles with UNHARMABILITY on,
             whether they have that special ability or not.  This gives
             players a little time to get adjusted or get where they
             want to be when the game gets in gear. [default: ON]
H        --  Half speed gravity.  This makes the game much easier;
             it is included because in multiplayer games, not all keystrokes
             will be received by the computer (them's breaks.)  Thus
             fewer flaps are required to keep a mount aloft.
Q        --  Quit the game.

Chapter 3.........Playing Joust

  In the classic Joust tradition, when two players collide, whichever
player is higher wins a battle.  The animals have to flap their wings
to become airborne, and of course, rapid flapping is the surest way to
the top.
  If the players collide at the same exact height, facing opposite
directions: The players bounce off of each other.  If they face the same
direction, one player is getting a lance in his back, and he loses.
  When the players hit the ground there is a certain amount of bounce
which can be used to their advantage.

Chapter 4.........Key Configuration

  To change the key configuration, run "KEYS.EXE".  The defaults are:

Player -->      1          2          3        4
Action
  \/
Flap:           W          Y          P      Up key/8 on num pad
Left:           A          G          L      Left key/4 on num pad
Right:          D          J          '      Right key/6 on num pad
Special:        S          H          ;      Center key/5 on num pad

Chapter 5.........Levels

  The ASCII file "LEVELS.DAT" contains the names of all the levels
currently being used and the number of levels in the file.  The first
line of LEVELS.DAT is the number of levels, and each line afterwards is
the name of one of the levels.  If the number at the top is changed

Chapter 6.........Animal information

  This chapter is devoted to notes about each type of animal.

Killer Parrot  -- This enormous species hails from South America, not
  far from the coast of Brazil, in the Amazon Basin.  Few have survived
  to tell the tale of their encounter with a killer parrot.
Pegasus        -- Ancient Greek myth tells the story of Pegasus, the
  winged horse, and Bellerophon, who mastered this beast.
Winged Buffalo -- Many have tasted the wings of these rare sights,
  whose wings are considered a gourmet item in North American bars.
  Winged Buffalos are found, thanks to bad wildlife preservation, in
  only a few areas of the U.S.A., and due to game poaching, their
  numbers are dwindling.
Moth           -- Hailing from the hills of West Virginia campgrounds
  come these moths with a 12 foot wingspan.  Attracted to the sight of
  lanterns, these enormous moths are very easy to catch and tame for the
  purposes of jousting.
Banana Warrior -- From an experiment by Corazon Aquino's biotechnology
  labs in the Philippines, known well around the world for their
  DNA-splicing feats, come these 6 foot tall bananas who use their skins
  to fly.  Their lifespan is short, and their brief moments are in pain
  because of the exposure of their delicate insides to the corrosive
  atmosphere.  However, the warriors die honorably, knowing that in
  death, they will be combating world hunger.
Catbird        -- Catbirds, which are winged cats, are constantly
  inflicting pain upon themselves; they love the taste of feathers and
  will bite their own wings for it.  But they are extremely quick
  animals which handle well in combat.
Bicycle Contraption -- In the 1880's T. Honus Pickford, an infamous
  American inventor, created a scheme to get a bike off the ground with
  wings.  Unfortunately his frame was too heavy, and he abandoned the
  project.  His grandson, C. Dick Pickford, revised the plans with
  modern day lightweight bicycle frames and thus created the most
  effective flying bicycle yet.  "The bike is hard to get airborne, but
  goes very fast." - Bicycling News World.
Purple Dinosaur -- More DNA work in the fields of genetics
  and paleontology has brought about the invention of these friendly,
  stupid 6.5' purple dinosaurs, who have a knack for educating children
  (those whom they don't eat first.)  They are very slow on the ground.
  The wings of these beasts are very effective, and extremely strong.
  Some jousters prefer the dinosaur's lack of speed for it's
  controllability.
Rolling Fish -- These fish, modified to live on the land, but physically
  unequipped to do so, are mounted on wheels such that when they flap
  their tails, they are able to go very fast, not unlike sailboats.  They
  also have powerful fins to flap upwards with, and the fish have thus
  adapted to living on land, in the air, and in the sea. These
  intelligent fish seem to find their land and air abilities similar to
  their sea skills, and can dart around at high speeds.
Classic Ostrich -- The Classic Ostrich is the original jousting steed,
  and while somewhat outdated, they are in style among jousters
  (jousting fashion is a fickle thing).  These are very powerful birds.

Chapter 7.........Notes for people studying physics

  The world on which SuperJoust takes place is a strange one.  There is no
wind resistance, so all creatures fall at the same rate; however, some are
faster flyers than others, which might seem unusual, since the implication
of no wind resistance implies that the animals are in a vacuum... Too bad.
  The gravity in SuperJoust is an accurate simulation of the real thing,
except scaled differently.  Gravity is, of course, acceleration, and is
therefore measured in distance units per time unit squared.  SuperJoust
gravity is no different, except that it is measured in the rather unusual
(to normal physicists) pixels per game cycle squared.  At any rate, the
parabolic arc of an object in the air is correct, so if you teach physics
you might want to show this part to your class for an example.  Maybe not.
(I mean, you could do the same thing with a tennis ball.  But kids like
SuperJoust more than tennis.  Trust me.)
  Collisions in SuperJoust are semi-accurate.  Crashing into walls is in-
accurate, but crashing into other animals (at exactly the same height) is
accurate, which is to say that momentum (mass*velocity) is taken into account.

Chapter 8.........Game Stuff, notes by the author

  This game was written on a 386 PS/2, 20 MHz.  My goal was a fun arcade
game in the classic tradition that was fast enough to play on a 386.  I
say this because most game companies write their games on top-of-the
line machines and thus make their games unplayable on anything except
that same processor.  If I wanted to write this on a Pentium, I wouldn't
know if it was playable on a 386, see?  So by writing it on a slightly
obsolete computer I have expanded the audience, etcetera.  You get the
idea, blah, blah, blah.  I'm just complaining because I've played a lot
of arcade games that sucked for speed *even* on a 486. (In 10 years I'll
read that and laugh.  But I'll still be able to play SuperJoust, because
it has delay control...)
  By the way, if you enjoy playing this game half as much as I enjoyed
writing it, then I enjoyed it twice as much as you.  Enjoy!
  Save my life! Send me lots of money!  This money will probably be
putting me through some college.  If it's not enough money I'll only be
able to buy textbooks, and I'll have to sleep on the dangerous streets of
New Haven (yeah, right) or someplace.
  For 20 dollars or more, you will be registered, and I will send you a
disk with registered SuperJoust, and put your name on a mailing list for
other stuff, and each time there is a new version you'll get it.  You'll
also get the level designer, and the sprite maker.
  For less than 20 dollars I will appreciate the donation plenty, but
you won't be registered.  Hey, this is worth 20 dollars!  At least I'm
not asking as much as "truly commercial" software...

  Empty your pockets off to:

  Ben Chadwick
  [address redacted]

  And (sendmoney) there is no subliminal advertising in *any*
(sendmoney) edition of SuperJoust, have no (sendmoney) fear.

  Even if you don't like SuperJoust, just remember that your money will be
going to a good cause (do I sound like PBS yet?) and that is
    - supporting Shareware and
    - appreciating the year of work that went into this project.

  By the way, I appreciate all questions, comments, hate mail, love mail,
money, and car keys, so feel free to send me any of these.  I will respond.
I plan to make future versions of SuperJoust, and I need to know what the
people want.  (If nobody registers, I suppose I won't bother...) Power to
the people!


About the Author
----------------

  Ben Chadwick is, at the time of this writing (November, 1994), a senior
at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, in Alexandria,
Virginia, USA.  He has spent the last year writing SuperJoust when not
doing thousands upon thousands of school assignments, and looks forward
to getting in to college (he may not, since he spent so much time writing
SuperJoust instead of doing the other thousand assignments).  The author
hopes someday to be made wealthy enough to give some of his money to fighting
homelessness, disease, and other evils of society; at the moment he is merely
hoping to fight the evil of high college prices.
